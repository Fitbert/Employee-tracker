# Employee-tracker
 using inquirer and sql to view data


## Challenge Week 12

Employee Tracker DB creator using node and inquirer.

## Your Task

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Because this Challenge will require the use of the `Inquirer` package, ensure that you install and use Inquirer version 8.2.4. To do so, use the following command in your project folder: `npm i inquirer@8.2.4`.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.


## Usage
You will need to install with "npm install" and then run "npm start" to start. You will have the ability to search and add employees to the database and also delete them.

## Refection

This activity continued from the previous challenge of using node and inquirer to create and render a different element for use. Getting more familiarity with the inquirer interface and development of the db environment has been intresting.
